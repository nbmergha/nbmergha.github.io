                <span class="hugeLetter">N</span>orth Carolina is a state that has never had a shortage of educational opportunities. For Black students interested in obtaining a higher education degree, N.C. boasts an extensive array of <a href="https://college.ai/Colleges/North-Carolina-Colleges.html">over 100 colleges and universities to choose from.</a> These higher education institutions are spread throughout the many cities and counties within the state. Historically Black Colleges and Universities like North Carolina Central University, Shaw University, North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, and Fayetteville State University provide a safe space to learn amongst one's own community. There are also long-standing universities like Duke and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to explore and learn from.

  <blockquote>
    <strong>
        <font size="+2">
“I think college is more accessible now than ever before,” said N.C. Central University graduate Christian Sharp. “The amount of HBCUs in North Carolina has a huge influence.”  
</blockquote>
</strong>
</font>
</div>

            <p class="paragraph">According to BestCollege.com, HBCUs graduates accounted for 48,000 of all college graduates from 2019 to 2020. In this same time period, over 200,000 students were enrolled in various historically Black colleges and universities across the country.</p>

<blockquote>

<font size="+2">
“Our responsibility is to guide our students in an educational environment that focuses on the highest ethical standards,” said N.C. Central University Mass Communication Chair Dr. Calvin Hall. “We want to help mold students who are empowered by the knowledge that they can develop their own ideas and use their expertise to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, as well as inform, enlighten, and interest our audiences.”

            <section>
             <p class="paragraph">Many students who choose to attend HBCUs do so partly because of the academics. However, these institutions also provide students with a rich and vibrant community. Many HBCUs are intentional about providing Black-centered opportunities for community building, activism, volunteering, and eating some of the best soul food you will ever have in your entire life.</p>
         </section>

  <p class="paragraph">Not only is North Carolina full of a plethora of universities to choose from, but it is also a state that offers many opportunities to its college graduates. With companies like Apple, Google, and IBM present within the Research Triangle Park it is no wonder that North Carolina has no issue sustaining a well-educated population and workforce. Talent.com states that the average income for N.C. college graduates is around $54,000.</p>
         </section>

          <p class="paragraph">In analyzing the three largest counties in North Carolina (Wake, Guilford, and Mecklenburg), it is clear that all three counties possess many Black college graduates. Mecklenburg County holds the largest amount of Black college graduates despite Wake County being the most populated county in the state. However, you can also see that Mecklenburg County has the highest amount of both high school and college dropouts as well. The graph also shows that Mecklenburg County, similarly to Guilford County, has a larger amount of people with some college education who did not graduate than college graduates. Mecklenburg County has the most colleges and universities in the state of North Carolina, boasting an impressive 26 colleges educating over 50,000 students. </p>

            <p class="paragraph">This data shows that, despite the growth of college graduates in the state, there are still obstacles and challenges that persist and make it difficult for everyone to obtain higher education degrees. It may not be a coincidence that tuition in N.C. has gone up nearly 10% in the last ten years. Despite N.C. being a state with a $7.25 minimum wage, the average cost of tuition is $8,201. It is likely that various institutional and systemic barriers come into play in the number of college graduates as well.

            <p class="paragraph">Graph 2 shows that Wake County has the second largest amount of Black college graduates with over 50,000 residents obtaining a bachelor’s degree or higher. A little over 10,000 residents in Wake County do not have a high school diploma. Unlike the other two counties.

            <p class="paragraph">Wake County has a larger amount of Black college graduates over any other educational demographic. This county has the 2nd highest number of colleges, but it has the highest number of students in the state. There are 16 colleges in Wake County educating over 65,000 students. This is not surprising because two of the largest colleges in the state, N.C. State University and UNC Chapel Hill, are located in Wake County. Wake County is also home to Shaw University, the first HBCU founded in the state.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Finally, graph 3 shows that Guilford County holds over 30,000 Black college graduates. Guilford County also has a slightly higher number of college dropouts than Wake County. Guilford County is home to North Carolina A&T University, widely considered one of the best HBCUs in the nation by outlets like College Consensus, Degree Choices, and University HQ.

 <section>
            <p class="paragraph">Overall, the data shows that Black higher educational attainment continues to grow in North Carolina. Surely in no small part due to the historical acceptance and graduation rates of HBCUs in the area. Incoming students should feel relief and peace knowing that, despite the recent Supreme Court ruling, there is a place for them in higher education regardless of their racial background.

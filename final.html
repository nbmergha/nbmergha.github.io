                <span class="hugeLetter">N</span>orth Carolina is a state that has never had a shortage of educational opportunities. For Black students interested in obtaining a higher education degree, there are <a href="https://college.ai/Colleges/North-Carolina-Colleges.html">over 100 options</a> to choose from spread throughout the many cities and counties within the state. Historically Black Colleges and Universities like North Carolina Central University, Shaw University, and Fayetteville State University provide a safe space to learn amongst ones own community. There are also long-standing universities like Duke and UNC to explore and learn from.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Not only is North Carolina full of a plethora of universities to choose from, but it is also a state that offers many opportunities to its college graduates. With companies like Apple, Google, and IBM present within the Research Triangle Park it is no wonder that North Carolina has no issue sustaining a well-educated population and workforce. </p>

             <p class="paragraph">In analyzing the three largest counties in North Carolina (Wake, Guilford, and Mecklenburg), it is clear that all three counties possess many Black college graduates. Mecklenburg County holds the largest amount of Black college graduates despite Wake County being the most populated county in the state. However, you can also see that Mecklenburg County has the highest amount of both high school and college dropouts as well. The graph also shows that Mecklenburg County, similarly to Guilford County, has a larger amount of people with some college education who did not graduate than college graduates. </p>

            <p class="paragraph">A little over 10,000 residents in Wake County do not have a high school diploma. Unlike the other two counties, Wake County has a larger amount of Black college graduates over any other educational demographic.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Finally, graph 3 shows that Guilford County holds over 30,000 Black college graduates. Guilford County also has a slightly higher number of college dropouts than Wake County.

            <p class="paragraph">Overall, the data shows that Black higher educational attainment continues to grow in North Carolina. Surely in no small part due to the historical acceptance and graduation rates of HBCUs in the area. Incoming students should feel relief and peace knowing that, despite the recent Supreme Court ruling, there is a place for them in higher education regardless of their racial background.
